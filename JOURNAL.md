## June 16th: Research!

I think it probably makes sense to use a RPi Zero 2w, since they are cost effective, and are able to work with cameras. They also dont have a ton of power draw. I also want to have a screen, since its always nice to see the pictures in color too. I found a USB thermal printer on amazon, it costs more than i thought it would.
